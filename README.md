# Advent of Code 2024 - Hare Language

I decided to do Advent of Code 2024 using [Hare language](https://harelang.org). 
Hare lang is descibed as :
> Hare is a systems programming language designed to be simple, stable, and robust. Hare uses a static type system, manual memory management, and a minimal runtime. It is well-suited to writing operating systems, system tools, compilers, networking software, and other low-level, high performance tasks.

I enjoy programming in C, and I have tried Zig before.
I find many of the goals of Hare to be admirable (especially it's focus on stability and maintainability).
Therefore, I wanted to dive in, and evaluate the language by participating in Advent of Code.
